<h2>Hello Eleventy</h2>
<h3>Files</h3>
<p>← README.md: That’s this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.
← index.html: Where you'll write the content of your website.
← style.css: CSS files add styling rules to your content.
← script.js: If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript.</p>
<h3>Next Steps</h3>
<p>If you want to build on this base, you could:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a page to view tags of posts</li>
<li>Add an author to your posts page with an avatar</li>
</ul>
