# Hello Eleventy

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) is a simple static site generator. That means you get all the power of a server-side framework but it builds plain HTML files that can be served as a fast, always-on static site.

## What's in this project?

← `README.md`: That’s this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← `build/`: These are the files for your your website, automatically generated by build scripts. They give you a preview while you're creating your app. When it goes to sleep, Glitch will automatically run the `build` NPM command and serve these files as a static site.

← `static/index.css`: The styling rules to your content.

← `src/`: This folder contains all the files Eleventy will use to build your site.

### Working in the `src/` folder

← `src/index.md`, `src/posts.md`, `src/about.md`,: These Markdown files are the content for 

← `src/posts/`: These are the Markdown files for the posts that make up your blog

← `src/_includes`: This is where all of your page level layouts go. The **\_** tells you that this is an _eleventy only_ folder.

← `src/_includes/seo.json`: When you're ready to share your new site or add a custom domain, change settings for social sharing in here.
