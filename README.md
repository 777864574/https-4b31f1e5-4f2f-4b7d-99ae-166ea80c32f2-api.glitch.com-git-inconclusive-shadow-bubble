## Hello Eleventy

### Files

← README.md: That’s this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← src/: Where you'll find the pages of your site, like about, blog and your home

← src/\_includes: This is where all of your page level layouts go

← static/index.css: CSS files add styling rules to your content.

### Next Steps

If you want to build on this base, you could:

- Add a page to view tags of posts
- Add an author to your posts page with an avatar
