## Hello Eleventy

### Files

← README.md: That’s this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← index.html: Where you'll write the content of your website.

← style.css: CSS files add styling rules to your content.

← script.js: If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript.

### Next Steps

If you want to build on this base, you could:

- Add a page to view tags of posts
- Add an author to your posts page with an avatar
