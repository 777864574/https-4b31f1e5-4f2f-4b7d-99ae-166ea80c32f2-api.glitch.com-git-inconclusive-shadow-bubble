## Hello Eleventy

[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) is a simple static site generator.

### What's in this project?

← README.md: That’s this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

← src/: Where you'll find the pages of your site, like about, blog and your home

← src/posts/: These are the Markdown files for the posts that make up your blog

← src/\_includes: This is where all of your page level layouts go. The **\_** tells you that this is an _eleventy only_ folder.

← static/index.css: CSS files add styling rules to your content.

← `build`: Your development bundle will be here while you're creating your app. When it goes to sleep, glitch will automatically run the `build` NPM command for a production build.
